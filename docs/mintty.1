.SH NAME

mintty \(en Cygwin terminal emulator

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBmintty\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... [ \fB-\fP | \fIPROGRAM\fP [\fIARG\fP]... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBMintty\fP is a terminal emulator for Cygwin with a native Windows user
interface and minimalist design.
Its terminal emulation is largely compatible with \fBxterm\fP, but it does not
require an X server.

.SH INVOCATION

If a program name is supplied on the command line, this is executed with any
additional arguments given.
Otherwise, mintty looks for a shell to execute in the \fISHELL\fP environment
variable.
If that is not set, it reads the user's default shell setting from
\fI/etc/passwd\fP.
As a last resort, it falls back to \fI/bin/sh\fP.
If a single dash is specified instead of a program name, the shell is invoked
as a login shell.

.SH OPTIONS

The standard GNU option formats are accepted, with single dashes
introducing short options and double dashes introducing long options.

.TP
\fB-c\fP, \fB--config\fP \fIFILENAME\fP
Read settings from the specified configuration file, in addition to
\fI/etc/minttyrc\fP and \fI~/.minttyrc\fP.
Configuration changes are saved to the last file thus specified and not 
read-only at the time of loading.

.TP
\fB-C\fP, \fB--loadconfig\fP \fIFILENAME\fP
Read settings from the specified configuration file, in addition to
\fI/etc/minttyrc\fP and \fI~/.minttyrc\fP.
The file is not taken into account for saving configuration changes.
This is useful to mix-in partial configuration variants, particularly 
colour schemes. However, \fB-o ThemeFile=\fIFILENAME\fP may be preferable.

.TP
\fB-e\fP, \fB--exec\fP \fIPROGRAM\fP [\fIARG\fP ...]
Execute the specified program in the terminal session and pass on any additional
arguments.

This option is present for compatibility with other terminal emulators only.
It can be omitted, in which case the first non-option argument, if any,
is taken as the name of the program to execute.

.TP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--hold\fP \fBnever\fP|\fBstart\fP|\fBerror\fP|\fBalways\fP
Determine whether to keep the terminal window open when the command has
finished and no more processes are connected to the terminal.
The argument can be abbreviated to a single letter.

By default, the window is closed immediately, except if the child process has
exited with status 255, which is used to indicate failure to execute the shell
command.  (Exit status 255 is also used by \fBssh\fP to indicate connection
errors.)

Alternatively, the window can be set to never stay open, to always stay open,
or to stay open only if the child process terminates with an error, i.e. with
a non-zero exit status or due to a signal indicating a runtime error.

.TP
\fB-i\fP, \fB--icon\fP \fIFILE\fP[\fB,\fIINDEX\fR]
Load the window icon from an executable, DLL, or icon file.  The optional
comma-separated index can be used to select a particular icon in a file with
multiple icons.

\fINote:\fP About interaction problems of icon, shortcut, and the Windows taskbar:
In a Windows desktop shortcut, to achieve consistent icon behaviour, 
the same icon should be specified in the shortcut properties (Change Icon...) 
and the mintty command line (Target:),
or (beginning 2.2.3) no icon should be specified on the command line as 
mintty will then take the icon from the invoking shortcut, 
also resolving a leading Windows environment variable (like %SystemRoot%).

.TP
\fB-l\fP, \fB--log\fP \fIFILE\fP|\fB-\fP
Copy all output into the specified log file, or standard output if a dash is
given instead of a file name.
If FILE contains \fB%d\fP it will be substituted with the process ID.
(See also \fIscript\fP(1) for a more flexible logging tool.)

.TP
\fB-o\fP, \fB--option\fP \fINAME\fP=\fIVALUE\fP
Override the named config file option with the given value, e.g.
\fC-o ScrollbackLines=1000\fP.

.TP
\fB-p\fP, \fB--position\fP \fIX\fB,\fIY\fR
Open the window with its top left corner at the specified coordinates.
Instead of coordinates, "centre" or "center" can be specified to place 
the window in the screen centre, and "right" or "bottom" can be specified 
to align the right or bottom window border with the right or bottom 
screen border (together with another option -p to specify an offset).

Option value "@N" where N is a number places the window on monitor N.

Multiple -p options can be combined; coordinates have a different meaning 
depending on other options:
.br
\(en With "left", "top", or "@N", related coordinates are relative to the monitor.
.br
\(en With "right" or "bottom", related coordinates adjust the right or bottom 
window border relative to the monitor.
.br
\(en Otherwise, coordinates are absolute and address the common multi-monitor 
address space as provided by Windows.

\fINote:\fP For another option to select the monitor for a new mintty window, 
see the description of Alt+F2.

.TP
\fB-s\fP, \fB--size\fP \fICOLS\fB,\fIROWS\fR
Set the default size of the window in character columns and rows.
(The xterm-like syntax \fICOLS\fBx\fIROWS\fR is accepted too.)
Instead of coordinates, "maxwidth" or "maxheight" can be specified;
this can be combined with another parameter \fB-s\fP for the other dimension.
The dimension for which "max" is applied is ignored in further \fB-s\fP or 
\fB-p\fP parameters.
For example, \fBmintty -s maxwidth -p 0,0 -s 0,10\fP will start a window 
at full screen width, positioned at the top of the screen, with 10 lines.

.TP
\fB-t\fP, \fB--title\fP \fITITLE\fP
Use \fITITLE\fP as the initial window title.
By default, the title is set to the executed command.

.TP
\fB-T\fP, \fB--Title\fP \fITITLE\fP
Use \fITITLE\fP as the permanent window title.
The title is not changeable by control sequences.
This feature is only available on the command line.

.TP
\fB-B\fP, \fB--Border\fP \fBframe\fP|\fBvoid\fP
Suppress window title, display only a frame or no border.
This feature is only available on the command line.

.TP
\fB-u\fP, \fB--utmp\fP
Create a utmp entry.

.TP
\fB-w\fP, \fB--window\fP \fBnormal\fP|\fBmin\fP|\fBmax\fP|\fBfull\fP|\fBhide\fP
Set the initial window state: normal, minimised, maximised, full screen,
or hidden.

.TP
\fB--class\fP \fICLASS\fP
Use \fICLASS\fP as the window class name of the main window.
This allows scripting tools to distinguish different mintty instances.
The default is "mintty".

.TP
\fB-d\fP, \fB--nodaemon\fP
Do not apply "daemonizing".
By default, mintty tries to detach itself from the invoking terminal when 
started from a Cygwin Console in order to avoid disabled signal reception, 
and when cloning the window (Alt+F2) in order to avoid a remaining zombie process.

.TP
\fB-D\fP, \fB--daemon\fP
Enforce "daemonizing".
By default, mintty tries to detach itself from the invoking terminal only 
as described above. With this option, it tries to detach always.
This makes a difference if a Windows "Shortcut key" is configured in a 
Windows desktop shortcut for starting mintty. Without daemonizing, the 
shortcut key will focus an already running instance of mintty, with 
daemonizing it always starts a new instance.

.TP
\fB-R\fP, \fB--Reportpos\fP \fImode\fP
Report position and size of window before mintty exits. This can be used 
to manage last window positions and reopen mintty windows accordingly.
Mode is "s" or "o" to choose short or long option syntax.
The restored (i.e. neither maximised nor minimised) geometry is reported 
and min/max/fullscreen information is added.

.TP
\fB--store-taskbar-properties\fP
Enable persistent storage of Windows taskbar properties together with 
options AppName and AppLaunchCmd.

.TP
\fB--nopin\fP
Prevent pinning of the mintty window to the Windows taskbar.

.TP
\fB-H\fP, \fB--help\fP
Display a brief help message and exit.

.TP
\fB-V\fP, \fB--version\fP
Print version information and exit.

.SH USAGE

Mintty tries to adhere to both Windows and Unix usage conventions.
Where they conflict, an option is usually provided.
This section primarily describes the default configuration;
see the \fBCONFIGURATION\fP section on how it can be customised.

.SS Menus

The context menu can be opened by right-clicking the mouse or by
pressing the \fBMenu\fP key that is normally located next to the right Ctrl key.

Mintty also adds a couple of items to the window menu, which can be accessed 
by clicking on the program icon or pressing \fBAlt+Space\fP.

Both menus have an entry that leads to the options dialog for changing mintty's
configuration.

.SS Copy & paste

Screen contents can be selected by holding down the left mouse button and
dragging the mouse.  If Alt is held down before the left mouse button, a 
rectangular block instead of whole lines will be selected.
The selection can be extended by holding down \fBShift\fP while left-clicking.
Double-clicking or triple-clicking selects a whole word or line, whereby word
selection includes special characters that commonly appear in file names and
URLs.

By default, selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.
This can be disabled on the \fBMouse\fP page of the options dialog.
Selected text can also be copied manually using either the \fBCopy\fP menu
command, the \fBCtrl+Ins\fP keyboard shortcut, or the middle mouse button
combined with \fBShift\fP.

The selected region is copied as "rich text" as well as normal text,
which means it can be pasted with colours and formatting into applications
that support it, e.g. word processors ("true colour" attributes are not supported).

The window title can be copied using the \fBCopy Title\fP command in the window
menu.

The clipboard contents can be pasted using either the \fBPaste\fP menu command,
the \fBShift+Ins\fP keyboard shortcut, or the middle mouse button.
Not only text but also files and directories can be pasted,
whereby the latter are inserted as Cygwin file names.
Shell quoting is added to file names that contain spaces or special characters.

.SS Drag & drop

Text, files and directories can be dropped into the mintty window.
They are inserted in the same way as if they were pasted from the clipboard.

.SS Opening files, directories and URLs

Files, directories, URLs and web addresses beginning with "www." can be 
opened either by holding \fBCtrl\fP while left-clicking on them, or by 
selecting them and choosing the \fBOpen\fP command from the context menu.
Please note that opening a file or directory with a relative path only works
correctly if the path refers to the current working directory of the process
invoked by mintty.

.SS Font zoom

The font size can be increased or decreased using the keyboard shortcuts
\fBCtrl+(keypad-)plus\fP and \fBCtrl+(keypad-)minus\fP, 
or by holding \fBCtrl\fP while rolling the mousewheel.
\fBCtrl+zero\fP or \fBCtrl+middle-mouse click\fP returns the font size 
to the default.
.br
\fIShift-coupled window-with-font zooming:\fP
If Shift is also held while zooming, the window will be resized to scale 
together with the font, keeping the terminal character size if possible.
This is not applied to the shifted numeric keypad "0" (which has other 
meaning) and to the shifted normal (non-keypad) "-" and "+" keys 
(because the shifted key could have a valid mapping, e.g. Ctrl+_, or the 
"+" key could be shifted itself already).
.br
Zooming by keyboard or mouse can be disabled, respectively, with options 
ZoomShortcuts=no or ZoomMouse=no.

.SS Drag resize

The usual windows function to drag on the window border resizes the terminal.
.br
\fIShift-coupled font-with-window zooming:\fP
If Shift is also held while resizing, the font will be scaled along with 
the resizing, unless disabled with ZoomFontWithWindow=false 
(which would help to avoid interference with certain shifted hotkeys configured 
to resize the window).
.br
Note that due to the different height/width factors, coupled font zooming 
is not a precise operation.

.SS DPI change

When DPI setting changes (by reconfiguration of display properties 
"what's on your screen ... smaller/medium/larger" or moving the mintty window 
between monitors with different DPI settings), mintty adapts its screen 
size to avoid Windows blurred auto-adaptation. If Shift is also held during 
the change, the font will be scaled too, roughly maintaining the screen 
dimensions.

.SS Full screen

Full screen mode can be toggled using either the \fBFull Screen\fP command in
the menu or either of the \fBAlt+Enter\fP and \fBAlt+F11\fP keyboard shortcuts, 
or the generic window title functions.

.SS Default size

If the window has been resized, it can be returned to the default size set in
the Window pane of the options using the \fBDefault size\fP command in the
menu or the \fBAlt+F10\fP shortcut.
\fBShift+Alt+F10\fP also restores the font size to its default.

.SS Reset

Sometimes a faulty application or printing a binary file will leave the
terminal in an unusable state. In that case, resetting the terminal's state
via the \fBReset\fP command in the menu or the \fBAlt+F8\fP keyboard shortcut
may help.

.SS Scrolling

Mintty has a scrollback buffer that can hold up to 10000 lines in the default
configuration.
It can be accessed using the scrollbar, the mouse wheel, or the keyboard.
Hold the \fBShift\fP key while pressing the \fBUp\fP and \fBDown\fP arrow keys
to scroll line-by-line or the \fBPageUp\fP and \fBPageDown\fP keys to scroll
page-by-page.

.SS Searching in the text and scrollback buffer

Alt-F3 opens a search bar with an input field for a search string. Matches are 
highlighted in the scrollback buffer. Enter/Shift+Enter find the next/previous 
position of the match and scrolls the scrollback buffer accordingly.
The appearance of the search bar and the matching highlight colours can be 
customized.

.SS Flip screen

Applications such as editors and file viewers normally use a terminal feature
called the alternate screen, which is a second screen buffer without scrollback.
When they exit, they switch back to the primary screen to restore the command
line as it was before invoking the application.

The \fBFlip Screen\fP menu command and \fBAlt+F12\fP shortcut allow looking
at the primary screen while the alternate screen is active, and vice versa.
For example, this allows to refer to past commands while editing a file.

.SS Switching session

The \fBCtrl+Tab\fP and \fBCtrl+Shift+Tab\fP shortcuts can be used to switch
between mintty windows.  Minimised windows are skipped.

.SS Closing a session

Clicking the window's close button, pressing \fBAlt+F4\fP, or choosing
\fBClose\fP from the window menu sends a \fISIGHUP\fP signal to the process
running in mintty, which normally causes it to exit.

That signal can be ignored, though, in which case the program might have to be
forced to terminate by sending a \fISIGKILL\fP signal instead.
This can be done by holding down \fBShift\fP when using the close button,
shortcut or menu item.

.SS Mouse tracking

When an application activates mouse tracking, mouse events are sent to the
application rather than being treated as window events.
This is indicated by the mouse pointer changing from an \fBI\fP shape to an
arrow.
Holding down \fBShift\fP overrides mouse tracking mode and sends mouse
events to the window instead, so that e.g. text can be selected and the context
menu can be accessed.

.SS Alt codes

The Windows Alt+Numpad method for entering character codes is supported,
whereby the Alt key has to be held while entering the character code.
Only the first key has to be on the numpad; subsequent digits can be entered
both on the numpad or the main part of the keyboard.

If the first key is the \fB'+'\fP on the numpad, the code is interpreted as
hexadecimal, whereby digits A through F can be entered using the letter keys.
If the first key is a zero, the code is interpreted as octal.
If the first key is any other digit from 1 to 9, the code is interpreted as
decimal.

For UTF-8 and other Unicode encodings such as GB18030, the entered code is
interpreted as a Unicode codepoint and encoded accordingly before it is sent.
For other encodings, the entered code is sent as is. If it doesn't fit into one
byte, it is sent as multiple bytes, with the the most significant non-zero byte
first.

Multi-monitor selection support: Alt+F2 will only spawn a new window 
after F2 has been released. While F2 is being held, the target monitor 
can be selected with a sequence of numeric keypad keys:
.br
\(en cursor-up/down/left/right (8/2/4/6) navigate the target focus to the 
respective neighbour in the monitor grid; 
.br
\(en the diagonal keys (7/9/1/3) combine two directions respectively; 
.br
\(en the central key (5) sets the target focus to the Windows "primary" monitor; 
.br
\(en the Ins key (0) or Del resets the focus to the current monitor.
.br
These navigation controls can be applied repeatedly to select a monitor further away.

Note that a heuristic algorithm is used, based on the size of the smallest 
monitor attached to the system, so the target may not always be selected 
as expected if multiple monitors of different size are available or 
monitors are not arranged in a regular grid.

.SH CONFIGURATION

Mintty has a graphical options dialog that can be reached via the context menu
or the window menu.  It has the following action buttons:
.br
\(en \fBCancel\fP: discards changes.
.br
\(en \fBSave\fP: applies and saves changes and closes the dialog.
.br
\(en \fBApply\fP: applies changes to the current instance of mintty 
  but does not save them to the configuration file. So using \fBApply\fP 
  then \fBCancel\fP, local changes can be applied (and tested) without 
  affecting further instances of mintty.

In configuration files, settings are stored as \fINAME\fP=\fIVALUE\fP pairs,
with one per line.  By default, they are read from \fI/etc/minttyrc\fP and
\fI~/.minttyrc\fP.  Additional configuration files can be specified using the
\fB-c\fP/\fB--config\fP or \fB-C\fP/\fB--loadconfig\fP command line options.
These are read in order, with settings in later files overriding those 
in earlier ones.
Configuration changes are saved to the last writable file specified with 
\fB-c\fP/\fB--config\fP, or \fI~/.minttyrc\fP if none is given.
Individual settings can also be specified on the command line using the 
\fB-o\fP/\fB--option\fP.

\fINote:\fP Many string values in the \fIminttyrc\fP files, especially those 
referring to file names or Windows items, are \fBUnicode-enabled\fP, 
meaning they are expected to be UTF-8-encoded in the configuration 
file independently of the encoding the terminal runs in; as a fallback, 
if the configuration value is not valid UTF-8, it is interpreted in 
the system ANSI encoding.
(This does not apply to the same configuration settings when given on the 
command-line.)
.br
Unicode-enabled settings: BellFile, ThemeFile, Title, ExitTitle, Icon, Log, 
Font, Printer, Answerback, Class, AppID, AppName, AppLaunchCmd.

Be careful when running multiple instances of mintty. If options are saved 
from different instances, obviously they can overwrite each other; if 
different mintty versions are run (e.g. from cygwin and msys sharing the same 
home directory), options may even get dropped from the configuration file.

The following sections explain the settings on each pane of the options
dialog, followed by settings that do not appear in the dialog.
For each setting, its name in the config file is shown in parentheses,
along with its default value.

If there is only a name in parentheses, there is currently 
no GUI configuration facility for that option 
(see also Hidden settings below).

.SS Looks
Settings affecting mintty's appearance.

.TP
\fBColours\fP
Clicking on one of the buttons here opens the colour selection dialog.
.br
In the settings (.minttyrc or command-line options), colours are 
represented as comma-separated RGB triples with decimal 8-bit values 
ranging from 0 to 255. X-style hexadecimal colour specifications such 
as #RRGGBB, rgb:RR/GG/BB or rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB can be used as well.
Also X11 color names are supported.
.br
\(en \fBForeground\fP (ForegroundColour=191,191,191)
.br
\(en \fBBackground\fP (BackgroundColour=0,0,0)
.br
\(en \fBCursor\fP (CursorColour=191,191,191)

\(en \fBTheme\fP (ThemeFile=): 
The popup offers theme files as stored in the resource directory 
$HOME/.mintty/themes for selection as a colour scheme.
The option can also be set to a filename (like D:/.../solarized-light.minttyrc).

.TP
\fBTransparency\fP (Transparency=off)
Window transparency level, with the following choices:
.br
\(en \fBOff\fP
.br
\(en \fBLow\fP
.br
\(en \fBMedium\fP
.br
\(en \fBHigh\fP
.br
\(en \fBGlass\fP

The \fBGlass\fP option is only available on Vista and above with desktop
compositing enabled.
To make this reasonably usable, the glass colour needs to be set to be as dark
as possible in the Windows control panel: choose \fIPersonalize\fP from the
desktop context menu, click on \fIWindow Color\fP, turn the colour intensity up
to the maximum, show the colour mixer, and turn the brightness down to black.

Numeric transparency values ranging from 4 to 254 can be specified in config
files or on the command line.  (Values below 4 are multiplied by 16, for
backward compatibility reasons.)

.TP
\fBOpaque when focused\fP (OpaqueWhenFocused=no)
Enable to make the window opaque when it is active (to avoid background
distractions when working in it).

.TP
\fBCursor\fP (CursorType=line)
The following cursor types are available:
.br
\(en \fBLine\fP
.br
\(en \fBBlock\fP
.br
\(en \fBUnderscore\fP

The line cursor is displayed with the width set in the Accessibility Options
control panel.

.TP
\fBCursor blink\fP (CursorBlinks=yes)
If enabled, the cursor blinks at the rate set in the Keyboard control panel.

.SS Text
Settings controlling text display.

.TP
\fBFont selection\fP
Clicking on the \fBSelect\fP button opens a dialog where the font and its
properties can be chosen.  Font styles other than \fBBold\fP are ignored.
In the config file, this corresponds to the following entries:
.br
\(en \fBFont\fP (Font=Lucida Console)
.br
\(en \fBFont style\fP (FontWeight=400, FontIsBold=no)
.br
\(en \fBSize\fP (FontHeight=9)
.br
The font selection dialog also offers an \fBApply\fP button for 
convenient testing how the selected font looks. Its function is the same 
as the \fBApply\fP button of the Options dialog.

Further settings can be given in the config file:
.br
\(en \fBFont boldness\fP (FontWeight=400): This is an implicit value after 
selecting a font in the font selection menu, or can be specified in the 
config file or on the command line for font selection. Typical weights 
are \fBNormal\fP/\fBRegular\fP (FontWeight=400) and \fBBold\fP (FontWeight=700 
or FontIsBold=yes) but if a font family has a different scheme or more than 
2 font weights, the weight value can be used for more specific selection.
.br
\(en \fBShow "hidden" fonts\fP (ShowHiddenFonts=no):
This hidden setting enables display of monospace fonts in the font selection 
menu even if they are marked to Hide in the Windows Font settings (from the 
Control Panel \(em Fonts folder).

.TP
\fBShow bold as font\fP (BoldAsFont=no)
When this option is enabled, the ANSI bold (or 'intense') text attribute is
shown as a bold-style font.  Where a bold variant of the selected font that
has the same width as the base font is available, that is used; otherwise, the
bolding is simulated by rendering the text twice with a one-pixel offset.

.TP
\fBShow bold as colour\fP (BoldAsColour=yes)
By default, text with the ANSI bold attribute set is displayed with a
different colour, usually with increased brightness.  This can be disabled
here.

Note that when \fBBoldAsFont\fP is enabled, only bold text in one of the eight
ANSI colours has its colour changed, i.e. bold text without an explicitly
specified colour is shown with a bold font only.  This matches \fBxterm\fP behaviour.

This option also controls how the 'half-bright' (or 'dim') text
attribute is displayed: if it is on, half-bright text is
shown with halved foreground colour brightness; otherwise, it is shown
by blending the foreground colour with the background colour.

.TP
\fBAllow blinking\fP (AllowBlinking=no)
When text blinking is disabled, as it is by default, the blink attribute is
displayed as a bold background colour instead.

.TP
\fBFont smoothing\fP (FontSmoothing=default)
Select the amount of font smoothing from the following choices:
.br
\(en \fBDefault\fP: Use Windows setting.
.br
\(en \fBNone\fP: With all the jaggies.
.br
\(en \fBPartial\fP: Greyscale anti-aliasing.
.br
\(en \fBFull\fP: Subpixel anti-aliasing ("ClearType").

.TP
\fBLocale\fP (Locale=)
The locale setting consists of a lowercase two-letter or three-letter language
code followed by a two-letter country code, for instance \fBen_US\fP or
\fBzh_CN\fP.  The Windows default system and user locales are shown in the
drop-down list for this setting.  Alternatively, the language-neutral "C"
locale can be selected.

If no locale is set here, which is the default, mintty uses the locale and
character set specified via the environment variables \fILC_ALL\fP,
\fILC_CTYPE\fP or \fILANG\fP.

If the locale option is set, however, it will override any environment
variable setting: \fILC_ALL\fP and the \fILC_*\fP variables for specific
locale categories are cleared, while \fILANG\fP is set according to the
selected locale and character set.

\fINote:\fP This means, while not strictly necessary, that also locale variables 
unrelated to the terminal character set (e.g. LC_MESSAGES) are cleared 
to avoid confusion.

.TP
\fBCharacter set\fP (Charset=)
The character set to be used for encoding input and decoding output.
If no locale is set, this setting is ignored.

While changing the character set takes effect immediately for text input and
ouput, it does not affect the processes already running in mintty.
This is because the environment variables of a running process cannot be
changed from outside that process.
Therefore mintty should be restarted for a character set change to take full
effect.

.SS Keys
Settings controlling keyboard behaviour.

.TP
\fBBackspace sends ^H\fP (BackspaceSendsBS=no)
By default, mintty sends \fB^?\fP (ASCII DEL) as the keycode for the backspace key.
If this option is enabled, \fB^H\fP is sent instead.
This also changes the \fBCtrl+Backspace\fP code from \fB^_\fP to \fB^?\fP.
(Corresponds to the xterm BackarrowKey resource.)

.TP
\fB\fP(DeleteSendsDEL=no)
By default, mintty sends VT100 Remove as the keycode for the keypad Del key.
If this option is enabled, \fB^?\fP (ASCII DEL) is sent instead.
(Corresponds to the xterm DeleteIsDEL resource.)

.TP
\fBCtrl+LeftAlt is AltGr\fP (CtrlAltIsAltGr=no)
The AltGr key on non-US Windows systems is a strange beast: pressing it is
synonymous with pressing the left Ctrl key and the right Alt key at the
same time, and Windows programs usually treat any Ctrl+Alt combination as
AltGr.

Some programs, however, chief among them Microsoft's very own Office, do not
treat Ctrl+LeftAlt as AltGr, so that Ctrl+LeftAlt combinations can be used in
command shortcuts even when a key has an AltGr character binding.

By default, mintty follows Office's approach, because a number of terminal
programs make use of Ctrl+Alt shortcuts.
The "standard" Windows behaviour can be restored by ticking the checkbox here.

The setting makes no difference for keys without AltGr key bindings
(e.g. any key on the standard US layout).

.TP
\fBCopy and Paste shortcuts\fP (ClipShortcuts=yes)
Checkbox for enabling the clipboard shortcuts \fBCtrl+Ins\fP for copying and
\fBShift+Ins\fP for pasting.

.TP
\fBMenu and Full Screen shortcuts\fP (WindowShortcuts=yes)
Checkbox for enabling the \fBAlt+Space\fP and \fBAlt+Enter\fP shortcuts for
showing the window menu and toggling full screen mode.

.TP
\fBSwitch window shortcuts\fP (SwitchShortcuts=yes)
Checkbox for enabling the \fBCtrl+Tab\fP and \fBCtrl+Shift+Tab\fP shortcuts
for switching between mintty windows.

.TP
\fBZoom shortcuts\fP (ZoomShortcuts=yes)
Checkbox for enabling the font zooming shortcuts \fBCtrl+plus/minus/zero\fP.

.TP
\fBAlt+Fn shortcuts\fP (AltFnShortcuts=yes)
Checkbox for enabling the use of combinations of Alt and functions keys as
shortcuts, for example \fBAlt+F4\fP for closing the window or \fBAlt+F11\fP
fortoggling  full screen mode.  Disable to have \fBAlt+Fn\fP combinations
sent to applications instead.

.TP
\fBCtrl+Shift+letter shortcuts\fP (CtrlShiftShortcuts=no)
Checkbox for enabling alternative clipboard and window command shortcuts
using \fBCtrl+Shift+letter\fP combinations such as \fBCtrl+Shift+V\fP for
paste or \fBCtrl+Shift+N\fP for starting a new session.

These can replace the \fBCtrl/Shift+Ins\fP and \fBAlt+Fn\fP shortcuts, whereby
they show up in menus only if the corresponding default shortcuts are disabled.

See the shortcuts section above for the list of shortcuts controlled by this
option.  When it is disabled, Ctrl+Shift+letter combinations are sent to
applications as C1 control characters instead.

.SS Mouse
Settings controlling mouse support.

.TP
\fBCopy on select\fP (CopyOnSelect=yes)
If enabled, the region selected with the mouse is copied to the clipboard as
soon as the mouse button is released, thus emulating X Window behaviour.

.TP
\fBCopy as rich text\fP (CopyAsRTF=yes)
If this option is enabled, which it is by default, text is copied to the
clipboard in rich text format (RTF) in addition to plain text format.
RTF preserves colours and styles when pasting text into applications that
support it, e.g. word processors.

.TP
\fBClicks place command line cursor\fP (ClicksPlaceCursor=no)
If enabled, the command line cursor can be placed by pressing the left
mouse button.
This works by sending the number of cursor keycodes needed to get to the
destination.

.TP
\fB\fP(MiddleClickAction=paste)
Action to take when the middle mouse button is pressed.
.br
\(en \fBPaste\fP: Paste the clipboard contents.
.br
\(en \fBExtend\fP: Extend the selected region.
.br
\(en \fBEnter\fP: Simulate \fBEnter\fP/\fBReturn\fP key.
.br
\(en \fBVoid\fP: Do nothing.

.TP
\fBRight click action\fP (RightClickAction=menu)
Action to take when the right mouse button is pressed.
.br
\(en \fBPaste\fP: Paste the clipboard contents.
.br
\(en \fBExtend\fP: Extend the selected region.
.br
\(en \fBEnter\fP: Simulate \fBEnter\fP/\fBReturn\fP key.
.br
\(en \fBMenu\fP: Show the context menu.

If this is set to \fBPaste\fP, the middle button extends the selected region
instead of pasting the clipboard. If it is set to \fBExtend\fP, a left click
with \fBShift\fP pressed pastes the clipboard instead of extending the
selection.

.TP
\fBMouse zooming\fP (ZoomMouse=yes)
Enabling font zooming with \fBCtrl+mouse-wheel/middle-mouse-click\fP.

.TP
\fBDefault click target\fP (ClicksTargetApp=yes)
This applies to application mouse mode, i.e. when the application activates
xterm-style mouse reporting.
In that mode, mouse clicks can be sent either to the application to process
as it sees fit, or to the window for the usual actions such as select and paste.
.br
\(en \fBWindow\fP
.br
\(en \fBApplication\fP

.TP
\fBModifier key for overriding default\fP (ClickTargetMod=shift)
The modifier key selected here can be used to override the click target in
application mouse mode.
With the default settings, clicks are sent to the application and Shift needs
to be held to trigger window actions instead.

The \fBOff\fP setting disables overriding.
.br
\(en \fBShift\fP
.br
\(en \fBCtrl\fP
.br
\(en \fBAlt\fP
.br
\(en \fBOff\fP

.TP
\fB\fP(HideMouse=on)
By default, mintty automatically hides the cross-hair mouse cursor when 
keyboard input is being entered. Setting this option =false keeps the cursor.

.SS Window
Window properties.

.TP
\fBColumns\fP (Columns=80)
Default width of the window, in character cells.

.TP
\fBRows\fP (Rows=24)
Default height of the window, in character cells.

.TP
\fB\fP(RowSpacing=0)
Additional row padding.

\fINote:\fP Mintty adjusts row spacing according to the font metrics, to 
compensate for tight or tall spacing of some fonts (e.g. Consolas, FreeMono, Monaco).
The RowSpacing value is added to that.

.TP
\fB\fP(ColSpacing=0)
Additional column padding; ColSpacing=1 can avoid boldened glyphs being clipped.

.TP
\fB\fP(Padding=1)
Window padding; margin between text and window border. The effective value 
is limited by the character cell width (scaling with font zooming).
A negative value indicates that always the character cell width shall be used,
without fixed limit.

.TP
\fBCurrent size\fP
Pressing this button sets the default width and height to the window's
current size.

.TP
\fBScrollback lines\fP (ScrollbackLines=10000)
The maximum number of lines to keep in the scrollback buffer.

.TP
\fBScrollbar\fP (Scrollbar=right)
The scrollbar can be shown on either side of the window or just hidden.
By default, it is shown on the right-hand side.
.br
\(en \fBLeft\fP
.br
\(en \fBNone\fP
.br
\(en \fBRight\fP

.TP
\fBModifier for scrolling\fP (ScrollMod=shift)
The modifier key that needs to be pressed together with the arrow up/down,
PgUp/PgDn, or Home/End keys to access the scrollback buffer.
The default is \fBShift\fP.
The \fBOff\fP setting disables scrolling with keyboard shortcuts.
.br
\(en \fBShift\fP
.br
\(en \fBCtrl\fP
.br
\(en \fBAlt\fP
.br
\(en \fBOff\fP

.TP
\fBPgUp and PgDn scroll without modifier\fP (PgUpDnScroll=no)
If this is enabled, the scrollback buffer can be accessed by just pressing
PgUp or PgDn, without the 'modifier for scrolling' selected above.
If the modifier is pressed anyway, plain PgUp/PgDn keycodes are sent to the
application.
This option does not affect the arrow keys or Home/End keys.

.SS Terminal
Terminal emulation settings.

.TP
\fBType\fP (Term=xterm)
The terminal type.  This determines the setting of the TERM environment variable
at mintty startup.
Choices available from the dropdown list are \fBxterm\fP, \fBxterm-256color\fP,
\fBxterm-vt220\fP, \fBvt220\fP, and \fBvt100\fP.

If the setting contains "vt220", xterm VT220-style function key mode is enabled
instead of the default PC-style function key mode.
(This can otherwise be set with the DECSET 1061 control sequence.)

Apart from that, this setting has no effect on mintty's terminal emulation,
i.e. all the features are always available. However, the TERM setting does tell
applications what features they can use.

The \fBxterm-256color\fP setting enables 256-color mode in some applications,
but may not be recognised at all by others, which is why plain \fBxterm\fP
is the default.

.TP
\fBAnswerback\fP (Answerback=)
The answerback string is sent in response to the \fB^E\fP (ENQ) character.
By default, this is empty.

.TP
\fBBell\fP
The options here determine what effects the bell character \fB^G\fP has.
Default beep and taskbar highlighting are enabled by default.
Mintty can also play wave sounds or frequency beeps.
.RS
\(en \fBBell system sound\fP (BellType=1): Preferred system sound, values:
.RS
\fB-1\fP : Simple Beep
.br
\fB0\fP : No Beep (overrides BellFile and BellFreq)
.br
\fB1\fP : Default Beep
.br
\fB2\fP : Critical Stop
.br
\fB3\fP : Question
.br
\fB4\fP : Exclamation
.br
\fB5\fP : Asterisk
.RE
\(en \fBWave\fP (BellFile=): 
The popup offers wave files as stored in the resource directory 
$HOME/.mintty/sounds for selection. The option can also be set 
to a filename (like D:/.../soundfile.wav).
This setting overrides the Bell system sound except No Beep.
.br
\(en \fBPlay\fP: The button plays the selected sound for testing.
The sound is also played when it is changed.
.br
\(en \fBFlash\fP (BellFlash=no): Briefly invert the foreground and background
colours.
.br
\(en \fBHighlight in taskbar\fP (BellTaskbar=yes): Change the colour of mintty's
taskbar entry if the mintty window is not active.

A simple \fBfrequency beep\fP can be configured in the configuration file 
or on the command line:
.br
\(en\fB\fP (BellFreq=0): Beep sound frequency (overrides system sounds).
.br
\(en\fB\fP (BellLen=400): Beep sound length (applies to frequency beep).
.RE

.TP
\fBPrinter\fP (Printer=)
The ANSI standard defines control sequences ("Media Copy") for sending 
text to a printer,
which are used by some terminal applications such as the mail reader
\fBpine\fP.
The Windows printer to send such text to can be selected here.
By default, printing is disabled.
If printing gets disabled in the Options menu, an active print connection 
will be ended; if the printer is changed, an active print connection 
will be continued with the previous printer.

.TP
\fBPrompt about running processes on close\fP (ConfirmExit=yes)
If enabled, ask for confirmation when the close button or \fIAlt+F4\fP is 
pressed and the command invoked by mintty still has child processes.
This is intended to help avoid closing programs accidentally.
If possible, mintty also displays a list of running child processes, 
using the procps command if installed, or the ps command.

.SS Command line
The settings here are config file versions of command line options
described in the OPTIONS section.  They do not appear in the options dialog.

.TP
\fBHolding the window open\fP (Hold=start)
The \fBHold\fP setting determines whether to keep the terminal window open when
the command has finished and no more processes are connected to the terminal.
It takes the following values:
.br
\(en \fBnever\fP: Don't keep the window open.
.br
\(en \fBstart\fP: Only keep the window open if the command exited with
status 255, which is used to indicate failure to start the command.
This is the default.
.br
\(en \fBerror\fP:  Keep the window open if the command exited with a non-zero
status or it was terminated by a signal indicating a runtime error.
.br
\(en \fBalways\fP: Always keep the window open.

.TP
\fBWindow icon\fP (Icon=)
The \fBIcon\fP setting with format \fIFILE\fP[\fB,\fIINDEX\fR] allows to load
the window icon from an executable, DLL, or icon file.
The optional comma-separated index can be used to select a particular icon in
a file with multiple icons.

If the setting is empty, as it is by default, mintty's program icon is used, 
unless mintty was invoked from a desktop shortcut in which case it uses 
the shortcut icon.

For interaction problems of icon, shortcut, and the Windows taskbar, 
see the note for the -i option above.

.TP
\fBLog file\fP (Log=)
The \fBLog\fP setting can be used to specify a log file that all output is
copied into.  If it is empty, as it is by default, no logging is done.
If it contains \fB%d\fP it will be substituted with the process ID.
See also the \fIscript\fP(1) utility for a more flexible logging solution.

.TP
\fBWindow title\fP (Title=)
The \fBTitle\fP setting can be used to determine the initial window title.
If it is empty, as it is by default, the title is set to the command being run.

.TP
\fBUtmp record\fP (Utmp=no)
If enabled, an entry for the session is written into the system's \fIutmp\fP
file for recording logins, so that the session appears for example in the
output of the \fIwho\fP(1) utility.

.TP
\fBInitial window state\fP (Window=normal)
This setting determines how the terminal window should be shown at startup:
.br
\(en \fBnormal\fP (default)
.br
\(en \fBmin\fP (minimised)
.br
\(en \fBmax\fP (maximised)
.br
\(en \fBfull\fP (full screen)
.br
\(en \fBhide\fP (invisible)

.TP
\fBWindow position\fP (X=, Y=)
\fBX\fP and \fBY\fP are integer settings that can be used to determine the
initial coordinates of the top left corner of the terminal window.
By default, these are unset, which means that the position suggested by the
window manager is used.

.TP
\fBWindow class name\fP (Class=mintty)
The \fBClass\fP setting determines the name of the window class of the terminal
window.  This can be used to help Windows scripting tools such as AutoHotKey to
distinguish different mintty windows.  The name defaults to "mintty".

.SS "Hidden" settings
The following settings appear neither in the options dialog nor as command line
options, which means they can only be set in config files or using the
\fB--option\fP command line option.

.TP
\fBApplication ID\fP (AppID=)
Windows 7 and above use the application ID for grouping taskbar items.
By default this setting is empty, in which case Windows groups taskbar
items automatically based on their icon and command line.  This can be
overridden by setting the AppID to a custom string, in which case windows
with the same AppID are grouped together.

\fIWarning:\fP Using this option in a Windows desktop shortcut may 
cause trouble with taskbar grouping behaviour. If you need to do that, 
the shortcut itself should also get attached with the same AppId.

\fIExplanation:\fP Note that Windows shortcut files have their own AppID.
Hence, if an AppID is specified in the mintty settings, but not on a 
taskbar-pinned shortcut for invoking mintty, clicking the pinned 
shortcut will result in a separate taskbar item for the new mintty window, 
rather than being grouped with the shortcut.
To avoid this, the shortcut's AppID has to be set to the same string, 
which can be done using the \fBWin7AppId\fP utility available cloned in 
the mintty utils repository \fIhttps://github.com/mintty/utils\fP.

.TP
\fBApplication Taskbar Shortcut Title\fP (AppName=)
The title of the Windows 7 taskbar shortcut. If the shortcut is pinned, 
the title is kept only if it was made persistent as described for 
AppLaunchCmd.

.TP
\fBApplication Taskbar Shortcut Launch Command\fP (AppLaunchCmd=)
The command to use if a shortcut pinned to the Windows 7 taskbar is invoked.
This is only effective if combined with an AppName option and the 
command-line option --store-taskbar-properties to make it persistent.
It should also be combined with an explicit and unique AppID.

\fINote:\fP The command must be given in Windows pathname syntax (e.g. 
AppLaunchCmd='C:\\cygwin\\bin\\mintty -T mytitle -').

\fINote:\fP An explicit icon supplied with the -i option can also be stored 
with the persistent properties; note, however, that for this purpose, 
it must be given in Windows pathname syntax and it must include a 
resource index; also, for consistent appearance, another -i option 
referring to the same icon should be included in the AppLaunchCmd 
(if the mintty invocation does not include an icon parameter but was 
started from a desktop shortcut, the icon in the AppLaunchCmd should 
be consistent with that one, respectively).

Example:
mintty -o AppID=Mintty.Pintest.1 -o AppName=Mintty.Pintest -o AppLaunchCmd="C:\\cygwin\\bin\\mintty -i /cygdrive/c/Windows/System32/calc.exe -" -i C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe,0 --store-taskbar-properties -

\fBWarning:\fP Once made persistent, the stored properties associated with 
a specific AppID cannot be removed or even modified again with normal means.
For this reason, it is advisable to use temporary AppIDs for testing 
(like MyMintty.1).

.TP
\fBWord selection characters\fP (WordChars=)
By default, this string setting is empty, in which case double-click word
selection uses the default algorithm that is geared towards picking out
file names and URLs.

If a string is specified here, word selection only picks out characters in the
string along with alphanumeric characters.  For example, specifying just the
underscore character (WordChars=_) would allow selecting identifiers in many
programming languages.

.TP
\fBWord selection exclusion characters\fP (WordCharsExcl=)
This string can list characters that are to be excluded from word selection.

.TP
\fBSpecial key remapping\fP
These options can attach a specific string to some special keys.
If the string is a number, a corresponding Escape sequence will be generated, 
applying Shift/Ctrl/Alt modifiers, following the pattern of function keys.
.br
If the string value contains a single control character, some generic 
Alt or Shift modification is applied.
For \fBPause\fP and \fBBreak\fP, control characters are the default values, 
they can be cleared with an empty assignment. For empty values, the default 
layout of the keyboard is applied.
.br
\(en \fBKey_Pause\fP=^] \fI(Ctrl+])\fP
.br
\(en \fBKey_Break\fP=^\\ \fI(Ctrl+\\)\fP
.br
\(en \fBKey_Menu\fP=
.br
\(en \fBKey_ScrollLock\fP=
.br
\(en \fBKey_PrintScreen\fP=

Examples:
.br
Key_Break=2 would turn the Break key into an Insert key
.br
Key_Menu=29 would make the Menu key send the same escape sequence as in xterm

.TP
\fBUse system colours\fP (UseSystemColours=no)
If this is set, the Windows-wide colour settings are used
instead of the foreground, background, and cursor colours chosen on the Looks
page of the options dialog.

.TP
\fBIME cursor colour\fP (IMECursorColour=)
The cursor colour can be set to change when the Input Method Editor (IME) for
entering characters not available directly on the keyboard is active.
The setting is a RGB triplet such as 255,0,0 for bright red.

By default, this is unset, which means that the cursor colour does not change.
The colour can also be changed using xterm's OSC 4 control sequence with
colour number 262.

.TP
\fBANSI colours\fP
These are the 16 ANSI colour settings along with their default values.
Colours are represented as comma-separated RGB triples with decimal 8-bit values
ranging from 0 to 255. 
X-style hexadecimal colour specifications such as #RRGGBB, 
rgb:RR/GG/BB or rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB can be used as well. 
Also X11 color names are supported.

.TP
\fBBold substitution colour\fP (BoldColour=)
The colour to be used instead of the bold attribute can be configured.
The bold substitution colour is only applied if option BoldAsFont is false 
and option BoldAsColour is true.
The default is \fInone\fP, meaning that a brightened colour derived from 
the effective foreground colour is used.
The bold substitution colour can also be set and reset with the respective xterm OSC 
control sequences.

.TP
\fBScrollback search colours\fP
The highlighting colours of search matches can be configured.
.br
\(en \fBSearchForegroundColour\fP=\fIblack\fP
.br
\(en \fBSearchBackgroundColour\fP=\fIlight yellow\fP
.br
\(en \fBSearchCurrentColour\fP=\fIbright yellow\fP

.TP
\fBScrollback search bar\fP (SearchBar=)
This string option can customize the order of items in the search bar.
Use x (close button), </> (previous/next buttons), s (search string) to 
select the order of these fields in the search bar; missing fields will 
be appended in a default order.

.TP
\fBWrite if exited\fP (ExitWrite=no)
Together with a hold option that keeps the terminal open after its child 
process terminated, this option always writes an exit indication to the 
screen. By default, only an error exit code is displayed.

.TP
\fBChange title if exited\fP (ExitTitle=)
Together with a hold option that keeps the terminal open after its child 
process terminated, this option prefixes the window title with its string, 
for example -o ExitTitle="TERMINATED: " or (in minttyrc) ExitTitle=TERMINATED: .

.TP
\fBDisable Shift-coupled implicit font zooming\fP (ZoomFontWithWindow=yes)
If this option is set to false, implicit font zooming coupled with 
window zooming by the Shift key is disabled, 
except for the keyboard zoom functions Shift+Alt+Enter/F11 and the Shift+menu function.

.SH LIMITATIONS

.SS Console issue

Mintty is not a full replacement for the Windows console window that Cygwin
uses by default.
Like xterm and rxvt, mintty communicates with the child process through a
pseudo terminal device, which Cygwin emulates using Windows pipes.
This means that native Windows command line programs started in mintty see
a pipe rather than a console device.
As a consequence, such programs often disable interactive input. Also,
direct calls to low-level Win32 console functions will fail.
Programs that access the console as a file should be fine though.

.SS Termcap/terminfo

Mintty does not have its own \fItermcap\fP or \fIterminfo\fP entries;
instead, it simply pretends to be an xterm.

.SS Missing xterm features

Mintty is nowhere near as configurable as xterm.  Of xterm's keyboard modes,
only the default PC-style and VT220-style are available.  8-bit control
characters are not supported, nor are ISO2022 character sets.  There is no
Tektronix 4014 emulation.  Mouse highlighting mode is not implemented.

The majority of xterm's many control sequences is implemented, but quite a few
are missing.  Significant omissions should be reported as bugs.
