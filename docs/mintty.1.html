<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mintty &ndash;
Cygwin terminal emulator</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mintty</b>
[<i>OPTION</i>]... [ <b>-</b> | <i>PROGRAM</i>
[<i>ARG</i>]... ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mintty</b>
is a terminal emulator for Cygwin with a native Windows user
interface and minimalist design. Its terminal emulation is
largely compatible with <b>xterm</b>, but it does not
require an X server.</p>

<h2>INVOCATION
<a name="INVOCATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a program
name is supplied on the command line, this is executed with
any additional arguments given. Otherwise, mintty looks for
a shell to execute in the <i>SHELL</i> environment variable.
If that is not set, it reads the user&rsquo;s default shell
setting from <i>/etc/passwd</i>. As a last resort, it falls
back to <i>/bin/sh</i>. If a single dash is specified
instead of a program name, the shell is invoked as a login
shell.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
GNU option formats are accepted, with single dashes
introducing short options and double dashes introducing long
options. <b><br>
-c</b>, <b>--config</b> <i>FILENAME</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read settings from the
specified configuration file, in addition to
<i>/etc/minttyrc</i> and <i>~/.minttyrc</i>. Configuration
changes are saved to the last file thus specified and not
read-only at the time of loading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-C</b>, <b>--loadconfig</b>
<i>FILENAME</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read settings from the
specified configuration file, in addition to
<i>/etc/minttyrc</i> and <i>~/.minttyrc</i>. The file is not
taken into account for saving configuration changes. This is
useful to mix-in partial configuration variants,
particularly colour schemes. However, <b>-o
ThemeFile=</b><i>FILENAME</i> <b>may be preferable.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-e, --exec</b>
<i>PROGRAM</i> <b>[</b><i>ARG</i> <b>...]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Execute the specified program
in the terminal session and pass on any additional
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
present for compatibility with other terminal emulators
only. It can be omitted, in which case the first non-option
argument, if any, is taken as the name of the program to
execute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h</b>, <b>--hold
never</b>|<b>start</b>|<b>error</b>|<b>always</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Determine whether to keep the
terminal window open when the command has finished and no
more processes are connected to the terminal. The argument
can be abbreviated to a single letter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
window is closed immediately, except if the child process
has exited with status 255, which is used to indicate
failure to execute the shell command. (Exit status 255 is
also used by <b>ssh</b> to indicate connection errors.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
the window can be set to never stay open, to always stay
open, or to stay open only if the child process terminates
with an error, i.e. with a non-zero exit status or due to a
signal indicating a runtime error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b>, <b>--icon</b>
<i>FILE</i>[<b>,</b><i>INDEX</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Load the window icon from an
executable, DLL, or icon file. The optional comma-separated
index can be used to select a particular icon in a file with
multiple icons.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i>
About interaction problems of icon, shortcut, and the
Windows taskbar: In a Windows desktop shortcut, to achieve
consistent icon behaviour, the same icon should be specified
in the shortcut properties (Change Icon...) and the mintty
command line (Target:), or (beginning 2.2.3) no icon should
be specified on the command line as mintty will then take
the icon from the invoking shortcut, also resolving a
leading Windows environment variable (like
%SystemRoot%).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l</b>, <b>--log</b>
<i>FILE</i>|<b>-</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy all output into the
specified log file, or standard output if a dash is given
instead of a file name. If FILE contains <b>%d</b> it will
be substituted with the process ID. (See also
<i>script</i>(1) for a more flexible logging tool.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-o</b>, <b>--option</b>
<i>NAME</i>=<i>VALUE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Override the named config file
option with the given value, e.g. <tt>-o
ScrollbackLines=1000</tt>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p</b>, <b>--position</b>
<i>X</i><b>,</b><i>Y</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Open the window with its top
left corner at the specified coordinates. Instead of
coordinates, &quot;centre&quot; or &quot;center&quot; can be
specified to place the window in the screen centre, and
&quot;right&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot; can be specified to
align the right or bottom window border with the right or
bottom screen border (together with another option -p to
specify an offset).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Option value
&quot;@N&quot; where N is a number places the window on
monitor N.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple -p
options can be combined; coordinates have a different
meaning depending on other options: <br>
&ndash; With &quot;left&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, or
&quot;@N&quot;, related coordinates are relative to the
monitor. <br>
&ndash; With &quot;right&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot;,
related coordinates adjust the right or bottom window border
relative to the monitor. <br>
&ndash; Otherwise, coordinates are absolute and address the
common multi-monitor address space as provided by
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i>
For another option to select the monitor for a new mintty
window, see the description of Alt+F2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s</b>, <b>--size</b>
<i>COLS</i><b>,</b><i>ROWS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the default size of the
window in character columns and rows. (The xterm-like syntax
<i>COLS</i><b>x</b><i>ROWS</i> is accepted too.) Instead of
coordinates, &quot;maxwidth&quot; or &quot;maxheight&quot;
can be specified; this can be combined with another
parameter <b>-s</b> for the other dimension. The dimension
for which &quot;max&quot; is applied is ignored in further
<b>-s</b> or <b>-p</b> parameters. For example, <b>mintty -s
maxwidth -p 0,0 -s 0,10</b> will start a window at full
screen width, positioned at the top of the screen, with 10
lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b>, <b>--title</b>
<i>TITLE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <i>TITLE</i> as the initial
window title. By default, the title is set to the executed
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-T</b>, <b>--Title</b>
<i>TITLE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <i>TITLE</i> as the
permanent window title. The title is not changeable by
control sequences. This feature is only available on the
command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-B</b>, <b>--Border
frame</b>|<b>void</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Suppress window title, display
only a frame or no border. This feature is only available on
the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-u</b>, <b>--utmp</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create a utmp entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-w</b>, <b>--window
normal</b>|<b>min</b>|<b>max</b>|<b>full</b>|<b>hide</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the initial window state:
normal, minimised, maximised, full screen, or hidden.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--class</b> <i>CLASS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <i>CLASS</i> as the window
class name of the main window. This allows scripting tools
to distinguish different mintty instances. The default is
&quot;mintty&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-d</b>,
<b>--nodaemon</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not apply
&quot;daemonizing&quot;. By default, mintty tries to detach
itself from the invoking terminal when started from a Cygwin
Console in order to avoid disabled signal reception, and
when cloning the window (Alt+F2) in order to avoid a
remaining zombie process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-D</b>, <b>--daemon</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enforce
&quot;daemonizing&quot;. By default, mintty tries to detach
itself from the invoking terminal only as described above.
With this option, it tries to detach always. This makes a
difference if a Windows &quot;Shortcut key&quot; is
configured in a Windows desktop shortcut for starting
mintty. Without daemonizing, the shortcut key will focus an
already running instance of mintty, with daemonizing it
always starts a new instance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-R</b>, <b>--Reportpos</b>
<i>mode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Report position and size of
window before mintty exits. This can be used to manage last
window positions and reopen mintty windows accordingly. Mode
is &quot;s&quot; or &quot;o&quot; to choose short or long
option syntax. The restored (i.e. neither maximised nor
minimised) geometry is reported and min/max/fullscreen
information is added.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--store-taskbar-properties</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable persistent storage of
Windows taskbar properties together with options AppName and
AppLaunchCmd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--nopin</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prevent pinning of the mintty
window to the Windows taskbar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-H</b>, <b>--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display a brief help message
and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print version information and
exit.</p>

<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mintty tries to
adhere to both Windows and Unix usage conventions. Where
they conflict, an option is usually provided. This section
primarily describes the default configuration; see the
<b>CONFIGURATION</b> section on how it can be
customised.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Menus</b>
<br>
The context menu can be opened by right-clicking the mouse
(with Shift in case right-click has been redefined) or by
pressing the <b>Menu</b> key that is normally located next
to the right Ctrl key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mintty also
adds a couple of items to the window menu, which can be
accessed by clicking on the program icon or pressing
<b>Alt+Space</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both menus have
an entry that leads to the options dialog for changing
mintty&rsquo;s configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Copy &amp;
paste</b> <br>
Screen contents can be selected by holding down the left
mouse button and dragging the mouse. If Alt is held down
before the left mouse button, a rectangular block instead of
whole lines will be selected. The selection can be extended
by holding down <b>Shift</b> while left-clicking.
Double-clicking or triple-clicking selects a whole word or
line, whereby word selection includes special characters
that commonly appear in file names and URLs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard. This
can be disabled on the <b>Mouse</b> page of the options
dialog. Selected text can also be copied manually using
either the <b>Copy</b> menu command, the <b>Ctrl+Ins</b>
keyboard shortcut, or the middle mouse button combined with
<b>Shift</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The selected
region is copied as &quot;rich text&quot; as well as normal
text, which means it can be pasted with colours and
formatting into applications that support it, e.g. word
processors (&quot;true colour&quot; attributes are not
supported).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The window
title can be copied using the <b>Copy Title</b> command in
the window menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The clipboard
contents can be pasted using either the <b>Paste</b> menu
command, the <b>Shift+Ins</b> keyboard shortcut, or the
middle mouse button. Not only text but also files and
directories can be pasted, whereby the latter are inserted
as Cygwin file names. Shell quoting is added to file names
that contain spaces or special characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Drag &amp;
drop</b> <br>
Text, files and directories can be dropped into the mintty
window. They are inserted in the same way as if they were
pasted from the clipboard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Opening
files, directories and URLs</b> <br>
Files, directories, URLs and web addresses beginning with
&quot;www.&quot; can be opened either by holding <b>Ctrl</b>
while left-clicking on them, or by selecting them and
choosing the <b>Open</b> command from the context menu.
Please note that opening a file or directory with a relative
path only works correctly if the path refers to the current
working directory of the process invoked by mintty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Font
zoom</b> <br>
The font size can be increased or decreased using the
keyboard shortcuts <b>Ctrl+(keypad-)plus</b> and
<b>Ctrl+(keypad-)minus</b>, or by holding <b>Ctrl</b> while
rolling the mousewheel. <b>Ctrl+zero</b> or
<b>Ctrl+middle-mouse click</b> returns the font size to the
default. <i><br>
Shift-coupled window-with-font zooming:</i> If Shift is also
held while zooming, the window will be resized to scale
together with the font, keeping the terminal character size
if possible. This is not applied to the shifted numeric
keypad &quot;0&quot; (which has other meaning) and to the
shifted normal (non-keypad) &quot;-&quot; and &quot;+&quot;
keys (because the shifted key could have a valid mapping,
e.g. Ctrl+_, or the &quot;+&quot; key could be shifted
itself already). <br>
Zooming by keyboard or mouse can be disabled, respectively,
with options ZoomShortcuts=no or ZoomMouse=no.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Drag
resize</b> <br>
The usual windows function to drag on the window border
resizes the terminal. <i><br>
Shift-coupled font-with-window zooming:</i> If Shift is also
held while resizing, the font will be scaled along with the
resizing, unless disabled with ZoomFontWithWindow=false
(which would help to avoid interference with certain shifted
hotkeys configured to resize the window). <br>
Note that due to the different height/width factors, coupled
font zooming is not a precise operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>DPI
change</b> <br>
When DPI setting changes (by reconfiguration of display
properties &quot;what&rsquo;s on your screen ...
smaller/medium/larger&quot; or moving the mintty window
between monitors with different DPI settings), mintty adapts
its screen size to avoid Windows blurred auto-adaptation. If
Shift is also held during the change, the font will be
scaled too, roughly maintaining the screen dimensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Full
screen</b> <br>
Full screen mode can be toggled using either the <b>Full
Screen</b> command in the menu or either of the
<b>Alt+Enter</b> and <b>Alt+F11</b> keyboard shortcuts, or
the generic window title functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default
size</b> <br>
If the window has been resized, it can be returned to the
default size set in the Window pane of the options using the
<b>Default size</b> command in the menu or the
<b>Alt+F10</b> shortcut. <b>Shift+Alt+F10</b> also restores
the font size to its default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reset</b>
<br>
Sometimes a faulty application or printing a binary file
will leave the terminal in an unusable state. In that case,
resetting the terminal&rsquo;s state via the <b>Reset</b>
command in the menu or the <b>Alt+F8</b> keyboard shortcut
may help.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scrolling</b>
<br>
Mintty has a scrollback buffer that can hold up to 10000
lines in the default configuration. It can be accessed using
the scrollbar, the mouse wheel, or the keyboard. Hold the
<b>Shift</b> key while pressing the <b>Up</b> and
<b>Down</b> arrow keys to scroll line-by-line or the
<b>PageUp</b> and <b>PageDown</b> keys to scroll
page-by-page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Searching in
the text and scrollback buffer</b> <br>
Alt-F3 opens a search bar with an input field for a search
string. Matches are highlighted in the scrollback buffer.
Enter/Shift+Enter find the next/previous position of the
match and scrolls the scrollback buffer accordingly. The
appearance of the search bar and the matching highlight
colours can be customized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Flip
screen</b> <br>
Applications such as editors and file viewers normally use a
terminal feature called the alternate screen, which is a
second screen buffer without scrollback. When they exit,
they switch back to the primary screen to restore the
command line as it was before invoking the application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>Flip
Screen</b> menu command and <b>Alt+F12</b> shortcut allow
looking at the primary screen while the alternate screen is
active, and vice versa. For example, this allows to refer to
past commands while editing a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Switching
session</b> <br>
The <b>Ctrl+Tab</b> and <b>Ctrl+Shift+Tab</b> shortcuts can
be used to switch between mintty windows. Minimised windows
are skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Closing a
session</b> <br>
Clicking the window&rsquo;s close button, pressing
<b>Alt+F4</b>, or choosing <b>Close</b> from the window menu
sends a <i>SIGHUP</i> signal to the process running in
mintty, which normally causes it to exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That signal can
be ignored, though, in which case the program might have to
be forced to terminate by sending a <i>SIGKILL</i> signal
instead. This can be done by holding down <b>Shift</b> when
using the close button, shortcut or menu item.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mouse
tracking</b> <br>
When an application activates mouse tracking, mouse events
are sent to the application rather than being treated as
window events. This is indicated by the mouse pointer
changing from an <b>I</b> shape to an arrow. Holding down
<b>Shift</b> overrides mouse tracking mode and sends mouse
events to the window instead, so that e.g. text can be
selected and the context menu can be accessed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alt
codes</b> <br>
The Windows Alt+Numpad method for entering character codes
is supported, whereby the Alt key has to be held while
entering the character code. Only the first key has to be on
the numpad; subsequent digits can be entered both on the
numpad or the main part of the keyboard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the first
key is the <b>&rsquo;+&rsquo;</b> on the numpad, the code is
interpreted as hexadecimal, whereby digits A through F can
be entered using the letter keys. If the first key is a
zero, the code is interpreted as octal. If the first key is
any other digit from 1 to 9, the code is interpreted as
decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For UTF-8 and
other Unicode encodings such as GB18030, the entered code is
interpreted as a Unicode codepoint and encoded accordingly
before it is sent. For other encodings, the entered code is
sent as is. If it doesn&rsquo;t fit into one byte, it is
sent as multiple bytes, with the the most significant
non-zero byte first.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Shortcuts</b>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Multi-monitor
selection support: Alt+F2 will only spawn a new window after
F2 has been released. While F2 is being held, the target
monitor can be selected with a sequence of numeric keypad
keys: <br>
&ndash; cursor-up/down/left/right (8/2/4/6) navigate the
target focus to the respective neighbour in the monitor
grid; <br>
&ndash; the diagonal keys (7/9/1/3) combine two directions
respectively; <br>
&ndash; the central key (5) sets the target focus to the
Windows &quot;primary&quot; monitor; <br>
&ndash; the Ins key (0) or Del resets the focus to the
current monitor. <br>
These navigation controls can be applied repeatedly to
select a monitor further away.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
heuristic algorithm is used, based on the size of the
smallest monitor attached to the system, so the target may
not always be selected as expected if multiple monitors of
different size are available or monitors are not arranged in
a regular grid.</p>

then <b>Cancel</b>, local changes can be applied (and
tested) without <br>
affecting further instances of mintty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In
configuration files, settings are stored as
<i>NAME</i>=<i>VALUE</i> pairs, with one per line. By
default, they are read from <i>/etc/minttyrc</i> and
<i>~/.minttyrc</i>. Additional configuration files can be
specified using the <b>-c</b>/<b>--config</b> or
<b>-C</b>/<b>--loadconfig</b> command line options. These
are read in order, with settings in later files overriding
those in earlier ones. Configuration changes are saved to
the last writable file specified with
<b>-c</b>/<b>--config</b>, or <i>~/.minttyrc</i> if none is
given. Individual settings can also be specified on the
command line using the <b>-o</b>/<b>--option</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i>
Many string values in the <i>minttyrc</i> files, especially
those referring to file names or Windows items, are
<b>Unicode-enabled</b>, meaning they are expected to be
UTF-8-encoded in the configuration file independently of the
encoding the terminal runs in; as a fallback, if the
configuration value is not valid UTF-8, it is interpreted in
the system ANSI encoding. (This does not apply to the same
configuration settings when given on the command-line.) <br>
Unicode-enabled settings: BellFile, ThemeFile, Title,
ExitTitle, Icon, Log, Font, Printer, Answerback, Class,
AppID, AppName, AppLaunchCmd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be careful when
running multiple instances of mintty. If options are saved
from different instances, obviously they can overwrite each
other; if different mintty versions are run (e.g. from
cygwin and msys sharing the same home directory), options
may even get dropped from the configuration file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sections explain the settings on each pane of the options
dialog, followed by settings that do not appear in the
dialog. For each setting, its name in the config file is
shown in parentheses, along with its default value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there is
only a name in parentheses, there is currently no GUI
configuration facility for that option (see also Hidden
settings below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Looks</b>
<br>
Settings affecting mintty&rsquo;s appearance. <b><br>
Colours</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Clicking on one of the buttons
here opens the colour selection dialog. <br>
In the settings (.minttyrc or command-line options), colours
are represented as comma-separated RGB triples with decimal
8-bit values ranging from 0 to 255. X-style hexadecimal
colour specifications such as #RRGGBB, rgb:RR/GG/BB or
rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB can be used as well. Also X11 color names
are supported. <br>
&ndash; <b>Foreground</b> (ForegroundColour=191,191,191)
<br>
&ndash; <b>Background</b> (BackgroundColour=0,0,0) <br>
&ndash; <b>Cursor</b> (CursorColour=191,191,191)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">&ndash;
<b>Theme</b> (ThemeFile=): The popup offers theme files as
stored in the resource directory $HOME/.mintty/themes for
selection as a colour scheme. The option can also be set to
a filename (like D:/.../solarized-light.minttyrc).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Transparency</b>
(Transparency=off)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Window transparency level, with
the following choices: <br>
&ndash; <b>Off</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Low</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Medium</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>High</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Glass</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Glass</b> option is only available on Vista and above
with desktop compositing enabled. To make this reasonably
usable, the glass colour needs to be set to be as dark as
possible in the Windows control panel: choose
<i>Personalize</i> from the desktop context menu, click on
<i>Window Color</i>, turn the colour intensity up to the
maximum, show the colour mixer, and turn the brightness down
to black.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Numeric
transparency values ranging from 4 to 254 can be specified
in config files or on the command line. (Values below 4 are
multiplied by 16, for backward compatibility reasons.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Opaque when focused</b>
(OpaqueWhenFocused=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable to make the window
opaque when it is active (to avoid background distractions
when working in it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Cursor</b>
(CursorType=line)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The following cursor types are
available: <br>
&ndash; <b>Line</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Block</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Underscore</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The line cursor
is displayed with the width set in the Accessibility Options
control panel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Cursor blink</b>
(CursorBlinks=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, the cursor blinks
at the rate set in the Keyboard control panel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Text</b>
<br>
Settings controlling text display. <b><br>
Font selection</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Clicking on the <b>Select</b>
button opens a dialog where the font and its properties can
be chosen. Font styles other than <b>Bold</b> are ignored.
In the config file, this corresponds to the following
entries: <br>
&ndash; <b>Font</b> (Font=Lucida Console) <br>
&ndash; <b>Font style</b> (FontWeight=400, FontIsBold=no)
<br>
&ndash; <b>Size</b> (FontHeight=9) <br>
The font selection dialog also offers an <b>Apply</b> button
for convenient testing how the selected font looks. Its
function is the same as the <b>Apply</b> button of the
Options dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Further
settings can be given in the config file: <br>
&ndash; <b>Font boldness</b> (FontWeight=400): This is an
implicit value after selecting a font in the font selection
menu, or can be specified in the config file or on the
command line for font selection. Typical weights are
<b>Normal</b>/<b>Regular</b> (FontWeight=400) and
<b>Bold</b> (FontWeight=700 or FontIsBold=yes) but if a font
family has a different scheme or more than 2 font weights,
the weight value can be used for more specific selection. If
a font family has no bold weight but boldness was requested,
mintty does not adhere to this scheme but enforces bold font
selection; however, in this case the bold attribute may not
be effective. <br>
&ndash; <b>Show &quot;hidden&quot; fonts</b>
(ShowHiddenFonts=no): This hidden setting enables display of
monospace fonts in the font selection menu even if they are
marked to Hide in the Windows Font settings (from the
Control Panel &mdash; Fonts folder).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Show bold as font</b>
(BoldAsFont=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When this option is enabled,
the ANSI bold (or &rsquo;intense&rsquo;) text attribute is
shown as a bold-style font. Where a bold variant of the
selected font that has the same width as the base font is
available, that is used; otherwise, the bolding is simulated
by rendering the text twice with a one-pixel offset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Show bold as colour</b>
(BoldAsColour=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, text with the ANSI
bold attribute set is displayed with a different colour,
usually with increased brightness. This can be disabled
here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
<b>BoldAsFont</b> is enabled, only bold text in one of the
eight ANSI colours has its colour changed, i.e. bold text
without an explicitly specified colour is shown with a bold
font only. This matches <b>xterm</b> behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
also controls how the &rsquo;half-bright&rsquo; (or
&rsquo;dim&rsquo;) text attribute is displayed: if it is on,
half-bright text is shown with halved foreground colour
brightness; otherwise, it is shown by blending the
foreground colour with the background colour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Allow blinking</b>
(AllowBlinking=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When text blinking is disabled,
as it is by default, the blink attribute is displayed as a
bold background colour instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Font smoothing</b>
(FontSmoothing=default)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select the amount of font
smoothing from the following choices: <br>
&ndash; <b>Default</b>: Use Windows setting. <br>
&ndash; <b>None</b>: With all the jaggies. <br>
&ndash; <b>Partial</b>: Greyscale anti-aliasing. <br>
&ndash; <b>Full</b>: Subpixel anti-aliasing
(&quot;ClearType&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Locale</b> (Locale=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The locale setting consists of
a lowercase two-letter or three-letter language code
followed by a two-letter country code, for instance
<b>en_US</b> or <b>zh_CN</b>. The Windows default system and
user locales are shown in the drop-down list for this
setting. Alternatively, the language-neutral &quot;C&quot;
locale can be selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If no locale is
set here, which is the default, mintty uses the locale and
character set specified via the environment variables
<i>LC_ALL</i>, <i>LC_CTYPE</i> or <i>LANG</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the locale
option is set, however, it will override any environment
variable setting: <i>LC_ALL</i> and the <i>LC_*</i>
variables for specific locale categories are cleared, while
<i>LANG</i> is set according to the selected locale and
character set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i>
This means, while not strictly necessary, that also locale
variables unrelated to the terminal character set (e.g.
LC_MESSAGES) are cleared to avoid confusion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Character set</b>
(Charset=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The character set to be used
for encoding input and decoding output. If no locale is set,
this setting is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">While changing
the character set takes effect immediately for text input
and ouput, it does not affect the processes already running
in mintty. This is because the environment variables of a
running process cannot be changed from outside that process.
Therefore mintty should be restarted for a character set
change to take full effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Keys</b>
<br>
Settings controlling keyboard behaviour. <b><br>
Backspace sends ^H</b> (BackspaceSendsBS=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, mintty sends
<b>^?</b> (ASCII DEL) as the keycode for the backspace key.
If this option is enabled, <b>^H</b> is sent instead. This
also changes the <b>Ctrl+Backspace</b> code from <b>^_</b>
to <b>^?</b>. (Corresponds to the xterm BackarrowKey
resource.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(DeleteSendsDEL=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, mintty sends VT100
Remove as the keycode for the keypad Del key. If this option
is enabled, <b>^?</b> (ASCII DEL) is sent instead.
(Corresponds to the xterm DeleteIsDEL resource.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Ctrl+LeftAlt is AltGr</b>
(CtrlAltIsAltGr=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The AltGr key on non-US Windows
systems is a strange beast: pressing it is synonymous with
pressing the left Ctrl key and the right Alt key at the same
time, and Windows programs usually treat any Ctrl+Alt
combination as AltGr.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Some programs,
however, chief among them Microsoft&rsquo;s very own Office,
do not treat Ctrl+LeftAlt as AltGr, so that Ctrl+LeftAlt
combinations can be used in command shortcuts even when a
key has an AltGr character binding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
mintty follows Office&rsquo;s approach, because a number of
terminal programs make use of Ctrl+Alt shortcuts. The
&quot;standard&quot; Windows behaviour can be restored by
ticking the checkbox here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The setting
makes no difference for keys without AltGr key bindings
(e.g. any key on the standard US layout).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Copy and Paste shortcuts</b>
(ClipShortcuts=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Checkbox for enabling the
clipboard shortcuts <b>Ctrl+Ins</b> for copying and
<b>Shift+Ins</b> for pasting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Menu and Full Screen
shortcuts</b> (WindowShortcuts=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Checkbox for enabling the
<b>Alt+Space</b> and <b>Alt+Enter</b> shortcuts for showing
the window menu and toggling full screen mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Switch window shortcuts</b>
(SwitchShortcuts=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Checkbox for enabling the
<b>Ctrl+Tab</b> and <b>Ctrl+Shift+Tab</b> shortcuts for
switching between mintty windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Zoom shortcuts</b>
(ZoomShortcuts=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Checkbox for enabling the font
zooming shortcuts <b>Ctrl+plus/minus/zero</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Alt+Fn shortcuts</b>
(AltFnShortcuts=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Checkbox for enabling the use
of combinations of Alt and functions keys as shortcuts, for
example <b>Alt+F4</b> for closing the window or
<b>Alt+F11</b> fortoggling full screen mode. Disable to have
<b>Alt+Fn</b> combinations sent to applications instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Ctrl+Shift+letter
shortcuts</b> (CtrlShiftShortcuts=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Checkbox for enabling
alternative clipboard and window command shortcuts using
<b>Ctrl+Shift+letter</b> combinations such as
<b>Ctrl+Shift+V</b> for paste or <b>Ctrl+Shift+N</b> for
starting a new session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">These can
replace the <b>Ctrl/Shift+Ins</b> and <b>Alt+Fn</b>
shortcuts, whereby they show up in menus only if the
corresponding default shortcuts are disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">See the
shortcuts section above for the list of shortcuts controlled
by this option. When it is disabled, Ctrl+Shift+letter
combinations are sent to applications as C1 control
characters instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mouse</b>
<br>
Settings controlling mouse support. <b><br>
Copy on select</b> (CopyOnSelect=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, the region selected
with the mouse is copied to the clipboard as soon as the
mouse button is released, thus emulating X Window
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Copy as rich text</b>
(CopyAsRTF=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this option is enabled,
which it is by default, text is copied to the clipboard in
rich text format (RTF) in addition to plain text format. RTF
preserves colours and styles when pasting text into
applications that support it, e.g. word processors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Clicks place command line
cursor</b> (ClicksPlaceCursor=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, the command line
cursor can be placed by pressing the left mouse button. This
works by sending the number of cursor keycodes needed to get
to the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(MiddleClickAction=paste)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Action to take when the middle
mouse button is pressed. <br>
&ndash; <b>Paste</b>: Paste the clipboard contents. <br>
&ndash; <b>Extend</b>: Extend the selected region. <br>
&ndash; <b>Enter</b>: Simulate <b>Enter</b>/<b>Return</b>
key. <br>
&ndash; <b>Void</b>: Do nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Right click action</b>
(RightClickAction=menu)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Action to take when the right
mouse button is pressed. <br>
&ndash; <b>Paste</b>: Paste the clipboard contents. <br>
&ndash; <b>Extend</b>: Extend the selected region. <br>
&ndash; <b>Enter</b>: Simulate <b>Enter</b>/<b>Return</b>
key. <br>
&ndash; <b>Menu</b>: Show the context menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If this is set
to <b>Paste</b>, the middle button extends the selected
region instead of pasting the clipboard. If it is set to
<b>Extend</b>, a left click with <b>Shift</b> pressed pastes
the clipboard instead of extending the selection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Mouse zooming</b>
(ZoomMouse=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enabling font zooming with
<b>Ctrl+mouse-wheel/middle-mouse-click</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Default click target</b>
(ClicksTargetApp=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This applies to application
mouse mode, i.e. when the application activates xterm-style
mouse reporting. In that mode, mouse clicks can be sent
either to the application to process as it sees fit, or to
the window for the usual actions such as select and paste.
<br>
&ndash; <b>Window</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Application</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Modifier key for overriding
default</b> (ClickTargetMod=shift)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The modifier key selected here
can be used to override the click target in application
mouse mode. With the default settings, clicks are sent to
the application and Shift needs to be held to trigger window
actions instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>Off</b>
setting disables overriding. <br>
&ndash; <b>Shift</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Ctrl</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Alt</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(HideMouse=on)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, mintty
automatically hides the cross-hair mouse cursor when
keyboard input is being entered. Setting this option =false
keeps the cursor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Window</b>
<br>
Window properties. <b><br>
Columns</b> (Columns=80)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Default width of the window, in
character cells.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Rows</b> (Rows=24)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Default height of the window,
in character cells.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(RowSpacing=0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Additional row padding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i>
Mintty adjusts row spacing according to the font metrics, to
compensate for tight or tall spacing of some fonts (e.g.
Consolas, FreeMono, Monaco). The RowSpacing value is added
to that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(ColSpacing=0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Additional column padding;
ColSpacing=1 can avoid boldened glyphs being clipped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Padding=1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Window padding; margin between
text and window border. The effective value is limited by
the character cell width (scaling with font zooming). A
negative value indicates that always the character cell
width shall be used, without fixed limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Current size</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pressing this button sets the
default width and height to the window&rsquo;s current
size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Scrollback lines</b>
(ScrollbackLines=10000)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of lines to
keep in the scrollback buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Scrollbar</b>
(Scrollbar=right)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The scrollbar can be shown on
either side of the window or just hidden. By default, it is
shown on the right-hand side. <br>
&ndash; <b>Left</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>None</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Right</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Modifier for scrolling</b>
(ScrollMod=shift)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The modifier key that needs to
be pressed together with the arrow up/down, PgUp/PgDn, or
Home/End keys to access the scrollback buffer. The default
is <b>Shift</b>. The <b>Off</b> setting disables scrolling
with keyboard shortcuts. <br>
&ndash; <b>Shift</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Ctrl</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Alt</b> <br>
&ndash; <b>Off</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PgUp and PgDn scroll without
modifier</b> (PgUpDnScroll=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this is enabled, the
scrollback buffer can be accessed by just pressing PgUp or
PgDn, without the &rsquo;modifier for scrolling&rsquo;
selected above. If the modifier is pressed anyway, plain
PgUp/PgDn keycodes are sent to the application. This option
does not affect the arrow keys or Home/End keys.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Terminal</b>
<br>
Terminal emulation settings. <b><br>
Type</b> (Term=xterm)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The terminal type. This
determines the setting of the TERM environment variable at
mintty startup. Choices available from the dropdown list are
<b>xterm</b>, <b>xterm-256color</b>, <b>xterm-vt220</b>,
<b>vt220</b>, and <b>vt100</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the setting
contains &quot;vt220&quot;, xterm VT220-style function key
mode is enabled instead of the default PC-style function key
mode. (This can otherwise be set with the DECSET 1061
control sequence.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Apart from
that, this setting has no effect on mintty&rsquo;s terminal
emulation, i.e. all the features are always available.
However, the TERM setting does tell applications what
features they can use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>xterm-256color</b> setting enables 256-color mode in some
applications, but may not be recognised at all by others,
which is why plain <b>xterm</b> is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Answerback</b>
(Answerback=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The answerback string is sent
in response to the <b>^E</b> (ENQ) character. By default,
this is empty.</p>

1</b> : Default Beep <b><br>
2</b> : Critical Stop <b><br>
3</b> : Question <b><br>
4</b> : Exclamation <b><br>
5</b> : Asterisk</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">&ndash; <b>Wave</b>
(BellFile=): The popup offers wave files as stored in the
resource directory $HOME/.mintty/sounds for selection. The
option can also be set to a filename (like
D:/.../soundfile.wav). This setting overrides the Bell
system sound except No Beep. <br>
&ndash; <b>Play</b>: The button plays the selected sound for
testing. The sound is also played when it is changed. <br>
&ndash; <b>Flash</b> (BellFlash=no): Briefly invert the
foreground and background colours. <br>
&ndash; <b>Highlight in taskbar</b> (BellTaskbar=yes):
Change the colour of mintty&rsquo;s taskbar entry if the
mintty window is not active.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A simple
<b>frequency beep</b> can be configured in the configuration
file or on the command line: <br>
&ndash; (BellFreq=0): Beep sound frequency (overrides system
sounds). <br>
&ndash; (BellLen=400): Beep sound length (applies to
frequency beep).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Printer</b> (Printer=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The ANSI standard defines
control sequences (&quot;Media Copy&quot;) for sending text
to a printer, which are used by some terminal applications
such as the mail reader <b>pine</b>. The Windows printer to
send such text to can be selected here. By default, printing
is disabled. If printing gets disabled in the Options menu,
an active print connection will be ended; if the printer is
changed, an active print connection will be continued with
the previous printer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Prompt about running
processes on close</b> (ConfirmExit=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, ask for
confirmation when the close button or <i>Alt+F4</i> is
pressed and the command invoked by mintty still has child
processes. This is intended to help avoid closing programs
accidentally. If possible, mintty also displays a list of
running child processes, using the procps command if
installed, or the ps command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Command
line</b> <br>
The settings here are config file versions of command line
options described in the OPTIONS section. They do not appear
in the options dialog. <b><br>
Holding the window open</b> (Hold=start)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>Hold</b> setting
determines whether to keep the terminal window open when the
command has finished and no more processes are connected to
the terminal. It takes the following values: <br>
&ndash; <b>never</b>: Don&rsquo;t keep the window open. <br>
&ndash; <b>start</b>: Only keep the window open if the
command exited with status 255, which is used to indicate
failure to start the command. This is the default. <br>
&ndash; <b>error</b>: Keep the window open if the command
exited with a non-zero status or it was terminated by a
signal indicating a runtime error. <br>
&ndash; <b>always</b>: Always keep the window open.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Window icon</b> (Icon=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>Icon</b> setting with
format <i>FILE</i>[<b>,</b><i>INDEX</i>] allows to load the
window icon from an executable, DLL, or icon file. The
optional comma-separated index can be used to select a
particular icon in a file with multiple icons.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the setting
is empty, as it is by default, mintty&rsquo;s program icon
is used, unless mintty was invoked from a desktop shortcut
in which case it uses the shortcut icon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For interaction
problems of icon, shortcut, and the Windows taskbar, see the
note for the -i option above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Log file</b> (Log=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>Log</b> setting can be
used to specify a log file that all output is copied into.
If it is empty, as it is by default, no logging is done. If
it contains <b>%d</b> it will be substituted with the
process ID. If it contains <b>%</b> placeholders other than
a single <b>%d</b>, the log file name will be constructed by
calling strftime(3) on the pattern; note that this is likely
to fail if a placeholder expands with &quot;/&quot;
(%D).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">See also the
<i>script</i>(1) utility for a more flexible logging
solution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Window title</b>
(Title=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>Title</b> setting can be
used to determine the initial window title. If it is empty,
as it is by default, the title is set to the command being
run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Utmp record</b>
(Utmp=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If enabled, an entry for the
session is written into the system&rsquo;s <i>utmp</i> file
for recording logins, so that the session appears for
example in the output of the <i>who</i>(1) utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Initial window state</b>
(Window=normal)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This setting determines how the
terminal window should be shown at startup: <br>
&ndash; <b>normal</b> (default) <br>
&ndash; <b>min</b> (minimised) <br>
&ndash; <b>max</b> (maximised) <br>
&ndash; <b>full</b> (full screen) <br>
&ndash; <b>hide</b> (invisible)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Window position</b> (X=,
Y=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> are
integer settings that can be used to determine the initial
coordinates of the top left corner of the terminal window.
By default, these are unset, which means that the position
suggested by the window manager is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Window class name</b>
(Class=mintty)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>Class</b> setting
determines the name of the window class of the terminal
window. This can be used to help Windows scripting tools
such as AutoHotKey to distinguish different mintty windows.
The name defaults to &quot;mintty&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Hidden
settings</b> <br>
The following settings appear neither in the options dialog
nor as command line options, which means they can only be
set in config files or using the <b>--option</b> command
line option. <b><br>
Application ID</b> (AppID=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Windows 7 and above use the
application ID for grouping taskbar items. By default this
setting is empty, in which case Windows groups taskbar items
automatically based on their icon and command line. This can
be overridden by setting the AppID to a custom string, in
which case windows with the same AppID are grouped
together.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Warning:</i>
Using this option in a Windows desktop shortcut may cause
trouble with taskbar grouping behaviour. If you need to do
that, the shortcut itself should also get attached with the
same AppId.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Explanation:</i>
Note that Windows shortcut files have their own AppID.
Hence, if an AppID is specified in the mintty settings, but
not on a taskbar-pinned shortcut for invoking mintty,
clicking the pinned shortcut will result in a separate
taskbar item for the new mintty window, rather than being
grouped with the shortcut. To avoid this, the
shortcut&rsquo;s AppID has to be set to the same string,
which can be done using the <b>Win7AppId</b> utility
available cloned in the mintty utils repository
<i>https://github.com/mintty/utils</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Application Taskbar Shortcut
Title</b> (AppName=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The title of the Windows 7
taskbar shortcut. If the shortcut is pinned, the title is
kept only if it was made persistent as described for
AppLaunchCmd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Application Taskbar Shortcut
Launch Command</b> (AppLaunchCmd=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The command to use if a
shortcut pinned to the Windows 7 taskbar is invoked. This is
only effective if combined with an AppName option and the
command-line option --store-taskbar-properties to make it
persistent. It should also be combined with an explicit and
unique AppID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i>
The command must be given in Windows pathname syntax (e.g.
AppLaunchCmd=&rsquo;C:\cygwin\bin\mintty -T mytitle
-&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Note:</i> An
explicit icon supplied with the -i option can also be stored
with the persistent properties; note, however, that for this
purpose, it must be given in Windows pathname syntax and it
must include a resource index; also, for consistent
appearance, another -i option referring to the same icon
should be included in the AppLaunchCmd (if the mintty
invocation does not include an icon parameter but was
started from a desktop shortcut, the icon in the
AppLaunchCmd should be consistent with that one,
respectively).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example: mintty
-o AppID=Mintty.Pintest.1 -o AppName=Mintty.Pintest -o
AppLaunchCmd=&quot;C:\cygwin\bin\mintty -i
/cygdrive/c/Windows/System32/calc.exe -&quot; -i
C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe,0 --store-taskbar-properties
-</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning:</b>
Once made persistent, the stored properties associated with
a specific AppID cannot be removed or even modified again
with normal means. For this reason, it is advisable to use
temporary AppIDs for testing (like MyMintty.1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Word selection
characters</b> (WordChars=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default, this string setting
is empty, in which case double-click word selection uses the
default algorithm that is geared towards picking out file
names and URLs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If a string is
specified here, word selection only picks out characters in
the string along with alphanumeric characters. For example,
specifying just the underscore character (WordChars=_) would
allow selecting identifiers in many programming
languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Word selection exclusion
characters</b> (WordCharsExcl=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This string can list characters
that are to be excluded from word selection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Special key
remapping</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These options can attach a
specific string to some special keys. If the string is a
number, a corresponding Escape sequence will be generated,
applying Shift/Ctrl/Alt modifiers, following the pattern of
function keys. <br>
If the string value contains a single control character,
some generic Alt or Shift modification is applied. For
<b>Pause</b> and <b>Break</b>, control characters are the
default values, they can be cleared with an empty
assignment. For empty values, the default layout of the
keyboard is applied. <br>
&ndash; <b>Key_Pause</b>=^] <i>(Ctrl+])</i> <br>
&ndash; <b>Key_Break</b>=^\ <i>(Ctrl+\)</i> <br>
&ndash; <b>Key_Menu</b>= <br>
&ndash; <b>Key_ScrollLock</b>= <br>
&ndash; <b>Key_PrintScreen</b>=</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Examples: <br>
Key_Break=2 would turn the Break key into an Insert key <br>
Key_Menu=29 would make the Menu key send the same escape
sequence as in xterm</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Use system colours</b>
(UseSystemColours=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this is set, the
Windows-wide colour settings are used instead of the
foreground, background, and cursor colours chosen on the
Looks page of the options dialog.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>IME cursor colour</b>
(IMECursorColour=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The cursor colour can be set to
change when the Input Method Editor (IME) for entering
characters not available directly on the keyboard is active.
The setting is a RGB triplet such as 255,0,0 for bright
red.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
this is unset, which means that the cursor colour does not
change. The colour can also be changed using xterm&rsquo;s
OSC 4 control sequence with colour number 262.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ANSI colours</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These are the 16 ANSI colour
settings along with their default values. Colours are
represented as comma-separated RGB triples with decimal
8-bit values ranging from 0 to 255. X-style hexadecimal
colour specifications such as #RRGGBB, rgb:RR/GG/BB or
rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB can be used as well. Also X11 color names
are supported. <br>
&ndash; <b>Black</b>=0,0,0 <br>
&ndash; <b>Red</b>=191,0,0 <br>
&ndash; <b>Green</b>=0,191,0 <br>
&ndash; <b>Yellow</b>=191,191,0 <br>
&ndash; <b>Blue</b>=0,0,191 <br>
&ndash; <b>Magenta</b>=191,0,191 <br>
&ndash; <b>Cyan</b>=0,191,191 <br>
&ndash; <b>White</b>=191,191,191 <br>
&ndash; <b>BoldBlack</b>=64,64,64 <br>
&ndash; <b>BoldRed</b>=255,64,64 <br>
&ndash; <b>BoldGreen</b>=64,255,64 <br>
&ndash; <b>BoldYellow</b>=255,255,64 <br>
&ndash; <b>BoldBlue</b>=96,96,255 <br>
&ndash; <b>BoldMagenta</b>=255,64,255 <br>
&ndash; <b>BoldCyan</b>=64,255,255 <br>
&ndash; <b>BoldWhite</b>=255,255,255</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Bold substitution colour</b>
(BoldColour=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The colour to be used instead
of the bold attribute can be configured. The bold
substitution colour is only applied if option BoldAsFont is
false and option BoldAsColour is true. The default is
<i>none</i>, meaning that a brightened colour derived from
the effective foreground colour is used. The bold
substitution colour can also be set and reset with the
respective xterm OSC control sequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Scrollback search
colours</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The highlighting colours of
search matches can be configured. <br>
&ndash; <b>SearchForegroundColour</b>=<i>black</i> <br>
&ndash; <b>SearchBackgroundColour</b>=<i>light yellow</i>
<br>
&ndash; <b>SearchCurrentColour</b>=<i>bright yellow</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Scrollback search bar</b>
(SearchBar=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This string option can
customize the order of items in the search bar. Use x (close
button), &lt;/&gt; (previous/next buttons), s (search
string) to select the order of these fields in the search
bar; missing fields will be appended in a default order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Write if exited</b>
(ExitWrite=no)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Together with a hold option
that keeps the terminal open after its child process
terminated, this option always writes an exit indication to
the screen. By default, only an error exit code is
displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Change title if exited</b>
(ExitTitle=)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Together with a hold option
that keeps the terminal open after its child process
terminated, this option prefixes the window title with its
string, for example -o ExitTitle=&quot;TERMINATED: &quot; or
(in minttyrc) ExitTitle=TERMINATED: .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Disable Shift-coupled
implicit font zooming</b> (ZoomFontWithWindow=yes)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this option is set to false,
implicit font zooming coupled with window zooming by the
Shift key is disabled, except for the keyboard zoom
functions Shift+Alt+Enter/F11 and the Shift+menu
function.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Console
issue</b> <br>
Mintty is not a full replacement for the Windows console
window that Cygwin uses by default. Like xterm and rxvt,
mintty communicates with the child process through a pseudo
terminal device, which Cygwin emulates using Windows pipes.
This means that native Windows command line programs started
in mintty see a pipe rather than a console device. As a
consequence, such programs often disable interactive input.
Also, direct calls to low-level Win32 console functions will
fail. Programs that access the console as a file should be
fine though.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Termcap/terminfo</b>
<br>
Mintty does not have its own <i>termcap</i> or
<i>terminfo</i> entries; instead, it simply pretends to be
an xterm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Missing
xterm features</b> <br>
Mintty is nowhere near as configurable as xterm. Of
xterm&rsquo;s keyboard modes, only the default PC-style and
VT220-style are available. 8-bit control characters are not
supported, nor are ISO2022 character sets. There is no
Tektronix 4014 emulation. Mouse highlighting mode is not
implemented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The majority of
xterm&rsquo;s many control sequences is implemented, but
quite a few are missing. Significant omissions should be
reported as bugs.</p>
