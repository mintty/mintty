Building mintty requires gcc >= 3.x for Cygwin or MSYS. It can not be 
built with a MinGW compiler, because it relies on some Unix facilities 
that are not available on plain Windows, in particular pseudo terminal 
devices (ptys).

Building mintty on cygwin needs packages `gcc-core` and `make`.
To compile, go into subdirectory `src` and run `make`.
To install, copy `mintty.exe` from subdirectory `bin` to an appropriate place.

See the top of the Makefiles for further make targets and options.
